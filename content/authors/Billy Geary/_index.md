Billy is an applied, quantitative ecologist interested in a range of topics, broadly focused on using applied and quantitative approaches for better managing and conserving biodiversity in a time of global change. This has spanned topics including fire ecology, spatial conservation planning and prioritisation, ecological forecasting, invasive species management and ecosystem modelling. 

Billy recently joined QAEco after graduating with his PhD from Deakin University in 2023 and spending almost a decade developing biodiversity decision-support tools, policy and research in the Victorian Government's Environment department.
